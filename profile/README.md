Image Editing: Photoshop allows users to make both simple and complex adjustments to photos and artwork, including cropping, resizing, retouching, and applying various filters and effects.

Layers and Masks: One of its standout features is the ability to work with layers. Layers allow users to manipulate different elements of an image independently, making editing more flexible and non-destructive. Masks enable users to hide or reveal parts of layers without permanently altering the image.

Selection Tools: Photoshop offers a range of selection tools (like the lasso, magic wand, and quick selection tools) that make it easy to isolate parts of an image for editing, coloring, or adjustments.

Brushes and Drawing Tools: Photoshop includes a variety of brushes and drawing tools for creating or editing artwork, such as digital painting, drawing, or texture creation.

Color Adjustments: You can modify the color balance, saturation, hue, contrast, brightness, and other aspects of an image. The software also includes advanced features like curves, levels, and gradient maps for precise color control.

Text and Typography: Photoshop offers advanced text editing tools, allowing users to create and modify text in various fonts, sizes, and effects.

3D and Motion Graphics: Photoshop supports basic 3D modeling and rendering tools, as well as features for creating animations and video editing.

Advanced Filters: Photoshop has a robust range of filters for creating artistic effects, blurring, sharpening, and many other enhancements to an image.

Integration with Other Adobe Products: Photoshop works seamlessly with other Adobe Creative Cloud apps like Illustrator, Lightroom, After Effects, and Premiere Pro, making it a key part of many creative workflows.

Photoshop is subscription-based and comes as part of the Adobe Creative Cloud suite, with both individual and team options. Its capabilities make it the go-to tool for professionals in fields ranging from graphic design and marketing to photography and web design.
